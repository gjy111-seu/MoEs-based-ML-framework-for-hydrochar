Codes for the work "A Mixture-of-Experts Machine Learning Framework for Predictive Design of Biomass-Derived Hydrochar to Decarbonize Industrial Heat".

The codes in the "Model on the Entire dataset development", "Clustering and visualization", "Expert models development" are for the "Construction of expert models for prediction" of this work.

The codes in the "Classification model for gating" are for the "Gating network construction" of this work.

The codes in the "Optimization algorithms" are for the "Multi-objective optimization of hydrochar properties" of this work.

The codes in the "Map drawing" are for the "Analysis of energy production and CO2 emission reduction potential of hydrochars" of this work.

The codes in the "Model on the Entire dataset development", "Clustering and visualization", "Expert models development" and "Classification model for gating" are used to train the machine learning models and should run on the corresponding dataset in the Supplementary Data.

The codes in the "Model on the Entire dataset development" and "Clustering and visualization" are based on the sheet "entire dataset" in the Supplementary Data. The codes in the "Hierarchical clustering" of "Expert models development" are based on the sheet "Hierarchical clustering_1" to "Hierarchical clustering_4" in the Supplementary Data. The codes in the "K-menas" of "Expert models development" are based on the sheet "Kmeans_1" to "Kmeans_3" in the Supplementary Data. The codes in the "Domain knowledge" of "Expert models development" are based on the sheet "Woody biomass" to "Others" in the Supplementary Data. The codes in the "Classification model for gating" are based on the sheet "Hierarchical clustering_1" to "Hierarchical clustering_4" in the Supplementary Data and each sheet should be assigned a classification label.
